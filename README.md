If you want to use this with your android phone as an external camera. You need to install ipwebcam on your phone
and have both your computer and phone on the same wifi.
Then, you can just add the --ipwebcam <link to local stream/video> which you'll find the link once you have
started the server on your phone.

You can also enable recording a video by using --enable_record in terminal.
--out_path enables you to choose the path and name for the recorded video

You can add as many countries as you want, do put them in the images folder and make sure to rename them as a proper
country name. You don't want the program to say Congragulations! you're going to  dlknsdfjksndfjqnflnsf-img
